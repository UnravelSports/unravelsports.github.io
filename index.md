<b>UnravelSports</b> is a Sports Data Analytics Research & Engineering Consultancy run by Joris Bekkers.

I have about five years of industry experience conducting football analytics research, developing state-of-the-art analytics models,
designing end-user centered custom and novel data visualizations, and building & integrating data analytics into day-to-day work flows
 at club and federation, having previously consulted for Premier League Club AFC Bournemouth
 and working for/with the U.S. Soccer Federation since 2018.

Below is an overview of some of my public work including football analytics research, a proof-of-concept multi-platform mobile/tablet app, data visualizations and interviews.
