## a

<body>
$${\tau = r F \sin \theta}$$
Where,
r = the length [m] the arm of the force around an object
F = the force vector, mass [kg] * acceleration [${m \over s^2}$]
</body>

<p>
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
