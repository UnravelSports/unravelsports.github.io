$${\tau = r F \sin \theta}$$

\(r \) = the length [\(m \)] the arm of the force around an object <br>
\(F \) = the force vector, mass [\(kg \)] * acceleration \(m \over s^2\) <br>
\(\theta \) = the angle between \(F \) and the arm

The torque \(\tau \)  around an object increases when the length of the arm [r] increases. When the angle Θ is at 90 degrees the applied torque is at its maximum, because sin 90° is 1. 
So the larger the lever and the straighter the angle, the higher the rotational force around an object.

Now, after doing some mental gymnastics, we can understand that when attempting to measure pressure in football we want to know something relatively close to the exact opposite of this. 
In football, we can say that when the distance between a pressing player and a pressed player - or ball or other point on the pitch - (r) get's larger the pressure decreases, because the pressed player has more space to escape.
Additionally, two players moving at 90 degrees from one-another are not interacting [\(cos(90°) = 0\)], whereas when two players moving at 0 degrees are running straight at each other [\(cos(0°) = 1\)], 
and at 180 degrees they are running in opposite directions [\(cos(180°) = -1\)].

Using the above we can rewrite the formula for torque in such a way that it more closely reflects what we have just defined for football.

$${\tau = {1 \over r} F \cos \theta}$$
$${\tau = 1 \over r F \cos \theta}$$

\(r \) = the distance between two players [\(m \)] <br>
\(F \) = the force vector, mass [\(kg \)] * acceleration \(m \over s^2\) <br>
