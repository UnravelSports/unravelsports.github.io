On April 6th 2023 during the inaugural [PySport](https://twitter.com/pysportorg?lang=en) Meet-up in Eindhoven I presented a way to render football tracking data in 3D using the Rust programming language and Bevy, a game engine built in Rust.

The purpose of this project was to learn more about 3D rendering to prepare for the eventual availability of 3D bose-pose data in sports.

More information on this project can be found in the GitHub repository linked below.
