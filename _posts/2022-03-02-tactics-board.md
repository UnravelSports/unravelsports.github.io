## ðŸ“± Tactics Board App

<div class="text-paperclip"> ðŸ“Ž [About a year ago today](2021/03/14/live-pitch-control.html) I released my first proof-of-concept multi-platform phone & tablet app (iOS/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unravelsports.base_app)) built in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) which showed a dummy live streamed feed of [Metrica Sports](https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data) open source data.</div>

In this post I want to show an app that would allow coaches, and technical and analytics staff, not only in soccer but in virtually any sport, to directly interact with advanced analytics models such as Pitch Control, and Expected Pass and Receiver models. To do this I leveraged the foundation of the previous app to build a <b>"tactical magnet board"</b>.

In this blog I want to showcase my ideas, but unfortunately I have to admit that this app has not (yet) made it's way to an app store. So, we'll have to make due with some screen capped videos.
