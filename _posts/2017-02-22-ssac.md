Somewhere at the end of 2015 or start of 2016 I finally learned how to code using Python, 
by building a webscraper (using [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)). This allowed me to scrape over 8000 matches worth of Opta event data from [Squawka](https://www.squawka.com).

In that same period I was in my first semester of the [Operations Management & Logistics](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-operations-management-and-logistics/) Master at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
Were, during basically every different course, from Spare Parts Management to Linear Optimization and Game Theory I was wondering about how to apply all of this information to the beautiful game of football.

Eventually this lead to me writing a research paper on [Network Motifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif) in football passing networks called: [<b>Flow motifs in soccer: What can passing behavior tell us?</b>](https://content.iospress.com/download/journal-of-sports-analytics/jsa190290?id=journal-of-sports-analytics%2Fjsa190290)
 under the supervision of with [Dr. Shaunak Dabadgao](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/shaunak-s-dabadghao/publications/), Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences. 
 
The research was accepted into the MIT Sports Analytics Conference in 2017 and published in the Journal of Quantitative Sports in 2019.

In this article we show how to support decision making within clubs by analyzing the unique passing behaviors (motifs) of players and teams from the patterns in their passing-possession data. 
We analyze individual players as well as teams based on the diversity and frequency of their involvement in different motifs. 
We gather passing and possession data from 4 seasons (2012â€“15) of 6 big European leagues with 8219 matches, 3532 unique players and 155 unique teams and apply the network motif concept to study the patterns.
 By introducing an expected goals model we build on the motif concept to measure the effectiveness of styles of play. 
 We also make use of a novel way to represent the motif data (the radar graph) to make comparisons between players and teams across multiple seasons. 
 We show how this analysis can support scouting for players and managers, identifying unique players/teams, finding relationships between position and style and in finding a suitable replacement for FC Barcelona's Xavi.
