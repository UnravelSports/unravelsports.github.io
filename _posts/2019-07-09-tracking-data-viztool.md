## Women World Cup 2019 Tracking Data Tool

After joining the U.S. Soccer Federation in 2018, and leading up to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, we developed an in-house tracking data visualization tool to help with the pre-match analysis of the coaching staff.

Tyler Heaps (former Director of Sporting Analytics) shared a video of the World Cup winning 2-0 goal by Rose Lavelle visualized in this tool.
