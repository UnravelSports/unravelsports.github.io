On Saturday June 7th 2025 I had the opportunity to present at [PyData London](https://pydata.org/london2025). My talk, titled _Cutting Edge Football Analytics using Polars, Keras and Spektral_, provided a hands-on introduction to building football analytics models with Polars, Keras, and Spektral. We started by exploring specific open-source football analytics Python libraries (kloppy and mplsoccer) followed by a brief introduction of basic Polars functionality, to efficiently process millions of player and ball coordinates from high-frequency positional tracking data. Next, we introduced Keras and Spektral for Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), demonstrating how these tools can be used to develop in-game prediction models and extract advanced football metrics, and how all of this is integrated in my Python package [`unravelsports`](https://github.com/UnravelSports/unravelsports).

More information on this Python package can be found in the GitHub repository linked below.
