On March 2nd 2023 [Amod Sahasrabudhe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amod-sahasrabudhe/) and myself had the opportunity to present our research paper titled ["_A Graph Neural Network deep-dive into successful counterattacks_"](https://ussf-ssac-23-soccer-gnn.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/Sahasrabudhe_Bekkers_SSAC23.pdf)[pdf] 
as one of the finalists of the 2023 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Research Paper Competition.

The purpose of this research is to build gender-specific, first-of-their-kind Graph Neural Networks to model the likelihood of a counterattack being successful and to uncover what factors make them successful in both men's and women's professional soccer. These models are trained on a total of 20,863 frames of algorithmically identified counterattacking sequences from synchronized StatsPerform on-ball event and SkillCorner spatiotemporal (broadcast) tracking data. The data - easily accessible within the Counterattack Jupyter Notebook - is derived from 632 games of MLS (2022), NWSL (2022) and international womenâ€™s soccer (2020-2022).
