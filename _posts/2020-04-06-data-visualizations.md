## ðŸ’» Custom Visualizations in R with ggplot

Back in April 2020 Tyler Heaps (former Director of Sporting Analytics at U.S. Soccer) shared some of the visualizations from 
automated post-match reports Kevin Shank, Rishi Kowalski (YNT Performance Analysts) and I had built prior to that time using R's ggplot library. 

Below are two examples of one of my favorite custom visualizations I contributed to this project.
Within these visualizations we use heatmaps both to show the relative frequency and execution location of certain actions - 
in this case open play defensive actions by midfielders and attackers, and passes into the box, but it can be used to
 visualize any type of action - within a single game as well as the relative frequency of these actions compared to 
 leagues average performance from the past year. The former is done by fitting a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution to the x,y coordinates 
 of the actions. The latter is done by choosing a 7 shade color palette for the plot from a total of 17 shades by comparing the total in-game action count to
  the total league-wide game-by-game action count distribution.

See the twitter thread below for more visualizations from these post-match reports.
